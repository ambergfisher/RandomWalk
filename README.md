This is a visualization of a random walk written in Javascript using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/). Read more about random walks [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk).

# How to run
Run your local server within the repository folder. On your browser, go to ```http://localhost:[your-port-num]```. 

If you don't know how to do this, here is how I do it:
1. Run ```npm install -g http-server``` to install Node http-server.
2. Navigate to the repo in your terminal and run ```http-server```.
3. In your browser, go to ```https://localhost:[port]```. The default port should be ```8080```.

# Features
- Grid vs. Mini modes: Grid mode displays a background grid as well as a larger move size. Mini mode is more granular in its move size and has no background grid.
- Reset: Click this button when you want to get a blank canvas so you can get a totally new picture.
